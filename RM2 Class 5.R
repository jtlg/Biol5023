    #All dplyr code
    # Some birds banded, not all
    # Some are recaptured in more than 1 year

    # Gain in mass over time for birds that have been recaptured

    # individually hand in assignment on ACORN
        # RMD file with graph and code-- echo the code

# factor reoorder command to tell R what order you want factors presented in

# a factor is a special type of character vector

# gsub command replaces something specified (A) with something else (b) gsub (A,B, dataframe)
# if pattern is consistent, you could just strsub() the first number of characters in a factor name
# system.time shows you how long it takes for cpu to perform task

# rename function
# you can rename while you're selecting
